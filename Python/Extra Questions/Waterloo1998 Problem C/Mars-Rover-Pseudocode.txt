Ask user for number of excursions
For counter=0 to number of excursions inputted by user:
	value = None
	While value is not 0:
		Prompt user for direction
		If direction is 0:
			Break the loop to store direction in a seperate list
		Else:
			Store the inputted value for future use

For counter=0 to number of excursions inputted by user:
	Set current direction to 0 degrees
	Set current x coordinate to 0 
	Set current y coordinate to 0
	For counter2=0 to number of values of directions in current excursion:
		Check if user input is 2: 
			Add 90 degrees to current direction
			If current direction is equal to 360 degrees:
				Set current direction back to 0
		Check if user input is 3:
			Subtract 90 degrees to current direction
			If current direction is less then 0 degrees:
				Set current direction to 270
		Check if user input is 1:
			If next user input is also 1:
				Add or subtract 1 to x or y depending on the direction value
				Set value of next user input to 0 (So it doesn't add anything, won't exit program since I store values before)
			Else: 
				Add or subtract user input to x or y depending on the direction value
	Print the shortest distance back which is the absolute value of x plus the absolute value of y
	Print the directions for the way back taking in count of positive or negative x or y values and directions
